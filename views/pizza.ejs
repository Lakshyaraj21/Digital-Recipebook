   <h1> Ingredients:</h1>
   <h2>For the Dough:</h2>
   <ul>
<li>500g (about 4 cups) Italian "00" flour (or bread flour)</li>
<li>325ml (about 1 1/3 cups) lukewarm water</li>
<li>10g (about 2 teaspoons) salt</li>
<li>5g (about 1 1/2 teaspoons) active dry yeast</li>
<li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>For the Toppings (Margherita):</h2>
   <ul>
<li>200g (about 7 ounces) fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
<li>200g (about 7 ounces) San Marzano tomatoes, crushed (or tomato passata)</li>
<li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
<li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<h1>Instructions:</h1>
 <h2>Prepare the Dough: </h2>
 <ol>
    <li> In a small bowl, combine the lukewarm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture.</li>
    <li>Gradually incorporate the flour into the wet ingredients until a dough forms.</li>
    <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 10-15 minutes until smooth and elastic.</li>
    <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until doubled in size.</li>
 </ol>

<h2> Prepare the Pizza:</h2>
<ul><li>Preheat your oven to its highest temperature, typically around 500-550°F (260-290°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to preheat.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 2 or 4 equal portions, depending on the desired size of your pizzas.</li>
    <li>On a floured surface, shape each portion of dough into a round ball, then flatten and stretch it into a thin circle, about 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) in diameter.</li>
    <li>Place the stretched dough on a pizza peel or parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Top the dough with crushed San Marzano tomatoes, leaving a border around the edges. Add slices of fresh mozzarella and fresh basil leaves on top.</li>
    <li>Drizzle with a little extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with salt.</li>
    <li>If using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza onto the hot stone in the oven. If using parchment paper, slide the pizza (on the parchment) onto a baking sheet or directly onto the oven rack.</li>
    <li>Bake the pizza for about 8-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your authentic Neapolitan pizza!</li>
</ul>
